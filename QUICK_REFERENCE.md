## ⚡ Updated Frontend Messaging

### Main Page:
- "Population-Level Risk Assessment"
- "Predict prevalence of symptoms in your demographic"
- Clear disclaimer about population vs individual

### Results Page:
- "Symptom Prevalence in Your Demographic: 24.5%"
- "of similar individuals report symptoms"
- "This represents population trends, not personal diagnosis"

## 📞 When To Seek Professional Help

**Regardless of the prevalence in your demographic, seek help if you experience:**

- Persistent sadness or hopelessness
- Loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed
- Significant changes in sleep or appetite
- Difficulty concentrating
- Thoughts of self-harm or suicide
- Excessive worry or fear
- Physical symptoms (headaches, stomach issues) without clear cause

**Remember:** Even if your demographic has "low prevalence" (e.g., 10%), that doesn't mean YOU don't have symptoms. The model shows population patterns, not individual diagnosis.

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Your Model Is:**
- 📊 A population health analysis tool
- 📈 A demographic risk assessment system
- 🎓 An educational resource about mental health prevalence
- 🌍 A public health planning tool

**Your Model Is NOT:**
- 🩺 A diagnostic instrument
- 👤 An individual symptom assessor
- 💊 A treatment recommendation system
- 🔮 A personal mental health predictor

**The frontend now clearly explains this distinction!** 🎉
